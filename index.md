Please select a game or interactive fiction to study for the entire term. No worries. You may change your selection at any point, if you'd like. 

Once each of us (including me!) selects a particular work, as a class we will assess how the mechanics of play in games and interactive fiction correspond with established genres. From there, we should be able to explain (to people who are not in this class) why genre matters when we not only analyze games and interactive fictiona but also experience them. 

## What Are Genres? 

We should probably begin by addressing the very notion of "genre." What is it? How does it behave? How is it categorized according to conventions and audience expectations? What are "subject," "style," "period," and "writing" genres?

## Metafiction

What's metafiction? How does it behave? How does it correspond with role-playing, "skeuomorphism," the "fourth wall," and even the use of voice-over? Metafiction will be a great opportunity for us to talk about interfaces ("HUDs"). 

Examples: *The Stanley Parable*, *OFF*, *Metal Gear Solid*, and *Her Story* 

## Fantasy 

What's fantasy? How does it behave? How does it correspond with the "fetch quest," "crafting," and the design of branching narratives? Fantasy also highlights techniques for character customization and worldbuilding, including maps. 

Examples: *Wildermyth* and *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* 

## Science Fiction 

What's science fiction? How does it behave? How does it correspond with forms of transport and travel? We'll return to character customization and worldbuilding, too. 

Examples: *Universal Paperclips*, *Portal 2*, and *Eliza* 

## Mystery 

What's mystery? How does it behave? How does it correspond with "environmental storytelling," the use of puzzles? 

Examples: *Return of the Obra Dinn* and *Overboard* 

## Action and Adventure 

What are action and adventure? How does it behave? How does it correspond with "silent protagonist," "quick-time events," "easter eggs," "pacifist mode," and the use of platforms? We'll use adventure to talk about inventory 

Examples: *Chicory: A Colorful Tale*, *Hollow Knight*, and *Outer Wilds* 

## Horror 

acousmatic sound. Horror is also an excellent genre for considerations of views and perspectives (first-person, second-person, third-person, isometric). 

## Western 

## Gothic 

What's the Gothic? How does it behave? How does it correspond with ? We'll also engage the Gothic through questions of agency, including player choices and interactions with NPCs. 

Examples: *Elden Ring*, *Sunless Sea*, and *Limbo* 

## Romance 

What's romance? How does it behave? 

Examples: *Mass Effect*, 

## Comedy

## Simulation 

simulation, fog of war 

## Memoir
