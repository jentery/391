Please select a game or interactive fiction to study for the entire term. No worries. You may change your selection at any point, if you'd like. 

Once each of us (including me!) selects a particular work, as a class we will assess how the mechanics of play in games and interactive fiction correspond with particular genres. From there, we should be able to explain (to people who are not in this class) why genre matters when we not only analyze games and interactive fiction but also experience them. 

## What Are Genres? 

We should probably begin by addressing the very notion of "genre." What is it? How does it behaved? How is it categorized? For example, what are "subject," "style," "period," and "writing" genres?

## Metafiction

What's metafiction? How does it behave? How does it correspond with the "silent protagonist" and the use of voice-over? 

Example: *The Stanley Parable* 

## Fantasy 

What's fantasy? How does it behave? How does it correspond with turn-based tactics, character customization, and the use of maps? 

Example: *Wildermyth* 

## Science Fiction 

## Mystery 



## Adventure 

## Horror 

## Western 

## Gothic 

## Romance 

What's romance? How does it behave? 

## Comedy

## Historical Fiction 

## Memoir
