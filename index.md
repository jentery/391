## Before We Begin

Please select two games or works of interactive fiction to study for the entire term. No worries. You may change your selections as the term unfolds. You are also more than welcome to pick works from the examples listed below. 

Once each of us (including me!) selects our particular works, we'll spend our weeks assessing how the mechanics of games and interactive fiction correspond with established storytelling genres. What's the relationship between narrative and play? From there, we should be able to explain (to people who are not in this class) why genre matters when we not only *analyze* games and interactive fiction but also *experience* them. 

## What Are Genres? 

We should probably begin by addressing the very notion of "genre." What is it? How does it behave? How is it categorized according to conventions and audience expectations? What are "subject," "style," "period," and "writing" genres?

Now, let's consider ten different genres. This list is by no means exhaustive. It's a sample. 

## 1. Metafiction

What's metafiction? How does it behave? How does it correspond with role-playing, "skeuomorphism," the "fourth wall," and even the use of voice-over? Metafiction will be a great opportunity for us to talk about interfaces ("HUDs"). 

Examples: *The Stanley Parable*, *OFF*, *Metal Gear Solid*, and *Her Story* 

## 2. Fantasy 

What's fantasy? How does it behave? How does it correspond with the "fetch quest," "crafting," "the chosen one," and the design of branching narratives? Fantasy will also help us attend to character customization and worldbuilding, including maps and "open worlds." We might return to role-playing as well. How does it morph across metafiction and fantasy? 

Examples: *Wildermyth*, *Final Fantasy*, *Slay the Spire*, and *The Legend of Zelda* 

## 3. Science Fiction 

What's science fiction? How does it behave? How does it correspond with forms of transport and travel? With magic and imaginary tech? We'll return to character customization and worldbuilding, too, and we'll talk more about movement in games and interactive fiction. 

Examples: *Universal Paperclips*, *Portal 2*, *80 Days*, *Into the Breach*, and *Eliza* 

## 4. Mystery 

What's mystery? How does it behave? How does it correspond with "environmental storytelling," "hidden items," and unlocking or solving puzzles? Mystery will nudge us to consider the conventions of crime and detective fiction, too, not to mention our various relationships with NPCs (non-player characters). 

Examples: *Return of the Obra Dinn*, *Disco Elysium*, *What Remains of Edith Finch*, and *Overboard* 

## 5. Action and Adventure 

What are action and adventure? How do they behave? How do they correspond with the "silent protagonist," "pacifist modes," "loops," flow, and the presence of platforms? We'll talk about inventory management and "ludonarrative dissonance," too.

Examples: *Chicory: A Colorful Tale*, *Hollow Knight*, and *Outer Wilds* 

## 6. Horror 

What's horror? How does it behave? How does it correspond with the use of "acousmatic sound," ambiences, photorealism, and "quick time events"? Horror will also be a chance for us to consider cameras and views (first-person, second-person, third-person, and isometric). 

Examples: *Resident Evil*, *Bogeyman*, *Amnesia*, and *Detention* 

## 7. The Gothic 

What's the Gothic? How does it behave? How does it correspond with the "cruel teacher," the grotesque, and conventions with respect to architecture and lighting? We'll also engage the Gothic through questions of player agency, including choice and the seemingly ludicrous. 

Examples: *Elden Ring*, *Sunless Sea*, *Castlevania*, and *Limbo* 

## 8. Historical Fiction  

What's historical fiction? How does it behave? How does it correspond with simulation, strategy, and "resource management," including documentation and record-keeping? Historical fiction will also create a space for us to consider the roles of cultural hegemony and educational "backdrops" in games. 

Examples: *Civilization*, *Assassinâ€™s Creed*, *The Oregon Trail*, and *Sunset* 

## 9. Romance 

What's romance? How does it behave? How does it correspond with dialogue options, gifting, dating sims, and the inclusion of certain "minigames"? Romance will be an opportunity for us to revisit a lot of the norms or assumptions at play in other genres, such as fantasy, mystery, adventure, and the Gothic. 

Examples: *Mass Effect*, *Birdland*, *Hades*, *Dream Daddy*, *Coffee Talk*, and *Stardew Valley* 

## 10. Comedy

Wait . . . comedy? In the context of games and interactive fiction? How does *it* behave? How does it correspond with surprises, glitches, failures, mods, banter, and "making your own fun"? Comedy will be another opportunity to revisit our discussions of genre this term. 

Examples: *WarioWare*, *The Sims*, and *Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy*

## What Genre? 

Games and interactive fiction are often associated with their own genres: Metroidvania, Soulslike, roguelike, 4X, sandbox, idle, and cozy games, for instance. But we'll end this course with a discussion of when and why particular works apparently resist genrefication. 

Examples: *Howling Dogs*, *Unpacking*, *Inscryption*, *Psychonauts 2*, and *Umurangi Generation*
