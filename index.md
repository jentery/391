Please select a game or interactive fiction to study for the entire term. No worries. You may change your selection at any point, if you'd like. 

Once each of us (including me!) selects a particular work, as a class we will assess how the mechanics of play in games and interactive fiction correspond with established storytelling genres. From there, we should be able to explain (to people who are not in this class) why genre matters when we not only analyze games and interactive fictiona but also experience them. 

## What Are Genres? 

We should probably begin by addressing the very notion of "genre." What is it? How does it behave? How is it categorized according to conventions and audience expectations? What are "subject," "style," "period," and "writing" genres?

## Metafiction

What's metafiction? How does it behave? How does it correspond with role-playing, "skeuomorphism," the "fourth wall," and even the use of voice-over? Metafiction will be a great opportunity for us to talk about interfaces ("HUDs"). 

Examples: *The Stanley Parable*, *OFF*, *Metal Gear Solid*, *Inscryption*, and *Her Story* 

## Fantasy 

What's fantasy? How does it behave? How does it correspond with the "fetch quest," "crafting," "the chosen one," and the design of branching narratives? Fantasy will also help us attend to character customization and worldbuilding, including maps and "open worlds." We might return to role-playing as well. How does it morph across metafiction and fantasy? 

Examples: *Wildermyth*, *Final Fantasy*, *Slay the Spire*, and *Legend of Zelda* 

## Science Fiction 

What's science fiction? How does it behave? How does it correspond with forms of transport and travel? With magic and imaginary tech? We'll return to character customization and worldbuilding, too, and we'll talk more about movement in games and interactive fiction. 

Examples: *Universal Paperclips*, *Portal 2*, *80 Days*, and *Eliza* 

## Mystery 

What's mystery? How does it behave? How does it correspond with "environmental storytelling," "hidden items," and the use of puzzles? Mystery will nudge us to consider the conventions of crime and detective fiction, too, not to mention our relationships with NPCs (non-player characters). 

Examples: *Return of the Obra Dinn*, *Disco Elysium*, *What Remains of Edith Finch*, and *Overboard* 

## Action and Adventure 

What are action and adventure? How do they behave? How do they correspond with the "silent protagonist," "pacifist modes," and the use of platforms? We'll talk about inventory management and "ludonarrative dissonance," too.

Examples: *Chicory: A Colorful Tale*, *Hollow Knight*, and *Outer Wilds* 

## Horror 

What's horror? How does it behave? How do they correspond with the use of "acousmatic sound," ambiences, photorealism, and "quick time events"? Horror will also be a chance for us to consider the design of views and perspectives (first-person, second-person, third-person, isometric). 

Examples: *Resident Evil*, *Bogeyman*, 

## Gothic 

What's the Gothic? How does it behave? How does it correspond with ? We'll also engage the Gothic through questions of agency, including player choices 

Examples: *Elden Ring*, *Sunless Sea*, and *Limbo* 

## Historical Fiction  

simulation, strategy, and resource management? 

Examples: *Civilization*, 

## Romance 

What's romance? How does it behave? 

Examples: *Mass Effect*, *Birdland*, 

## Comedy



## Memoir 

## What Genre? 

Examples: *Howling Dogs*, *Unpacking*, and
